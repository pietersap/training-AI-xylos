Several weeks ago I had some chocolate dipped strawberries that had been soaked in liquor before being dipped in chocolate.  I thought I could taste alcohol, but my dining companion didn't taste it.  So it wasn't a strong flavor.  Is there any information out there on how much alcohol may have been transferred to the strawberries? </p>\r\n","\n","******************************************************************************************\n","<p>I live about 8 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico. It will be in the low teens (below freezing) in the morning. It will be record setting, so I'm not sure what to expect. The pump and equipment is in a heated room however I don't know what the temps could do to the pool and everything outside.

The password is long and unbruteforceable, but I recently read that WinRAR uses PBDKF2 as its key-derivation function instead of generating a new volume key every time like TrueCrypt, which means that in essence all of these volumes have the same 256-bit key.</p>\r\n","\r\n","<p>Does that mean that if attackers got ahold of these volumes, they can use techniques similar to crib-dragging to extract the master password? Also, are these kind of attacks practical (i.e. have there been published success stories of such attacks)? I tried searching on Google but found nothing close to what I wanted.</p>\r\n","\n","******************************************************************************************\n","<p>One of our showers has an intermittent leak, and I've figured out that it happens when the hot water heater is on. There's no expansion tank on the cold supply side for our hot water tank, so I'm guessing that the increased pressure while the heater is on is causing the leak.</p>\r\n","\r\n","<p>I picked up a <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00004RACK\" rel=\"nofollow\">cheap water pressure gauge</a> and measured the cold water pressure at a slop sink in the basement at 100 psi. Presumably that gets even higher when the water heater is on.</p>\r\n","\r\n","<p>I had been thinking that an expansion tank would solve this problem, but now it seems like the water pressure is just too high in general. Do I need something else? Should I just repair / replace the shower faucet and leave the pressure alone?</p>\r\n","\r\n","<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> There's definitely no pressure-reducing valve inside the house where water service enters. Our water meter is outside near the street, under a small manhole cover. Might the PRV be in there as well? I couldn't find an obvious way to get into it, perhaps I need a crowbar or something? Municipal water service was installed at this property relatively recently; prior to that it was on well water.</p>\r\n","\r\n","<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I've measured the cold line as high as 170 psi while the hot water heater is on.
